## Synopsis

Use Flask to open a csv file and display a result based upon a conditon.


## Motivation
### diek's missing step 2.
I searched several times for a simple example of using a csv and Flask. This small app fills part of the gap between "hello world" - step 1 and the official Flask 'flaskr' example - step 3, imho.
This is very basic example of using Flask with a csv, to display the result of a simple condition.

## Installation  

- Use virtualenv + virtualwrapper  
- `$:pip install requirements.txt`

## CSV File
The file is from "Think Like a Computer Scientist", and the premise is based on <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/Files/Iteratingoverlinesinafile.html">"Working With Data Files"</a> and quarterback stats.


## Tests

Yes, important. This is step 2, tests happen later ... check out the crew @ Real Python's example <a href="https://realpython.com/blog/python/the-minimum-viable-test-suite/">Minimum Viable Test Suite</a>
