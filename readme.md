## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation
### diek's missing step 2.
I searched several times for a simple example of using a csv and Flask. This small app fills part of the gap between "hello world" - step 1 and the official Flask 'flaskr' example - step 3, imho.
This is very basic example of using Flask with a csv, to display the result of a simple condition.

## Installation

Use virtualenv + virtualwrapper
pip install requirements


## Tests

This is step 2, tests happen later ... step 4 perhaps.
